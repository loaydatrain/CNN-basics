# CNN Basics

Learnt how to create dataloaders, models and training code in PyTorch. The following models were created and analysis carried out:
- With Batch Norm
- Adding new layers
- With Dropout
- Different activation functions at the end
- Different pooling strategies
- Different optimizers
- Basic Augmentation like Rotation, Translation, Color Change

## Dataset
It is available [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/chunin-exams-food-track-cv-2021/dataset_files). There are approximately 9233 images in train and 484 images in test set. 

## Submission
The submission is for [this challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/chunin-exams-food-track-cv-2021) on ai-crowd portal. This was done using a resnet-50 pre-trained model.
